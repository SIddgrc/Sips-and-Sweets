	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<p>1. Is there a market for my food product?</p>
	<textarea name="message" rows="8" cols="100">	Most food businesses start with a product idea or a family recipe, but with little information on the market potential of the product. Family members and friends may have suggested the entrepreneur market the product, but does that constitute the product’s marketability?
	
	A good starting point is to perform an Internet search for similar products, and to visit a few supermarkets. If these searches indicate the availability of similar products, a market for the product probably exists. However, the presence of similar products also means the existence of competitors. Carefully consider how other products are made and their packaging, marketing tactics and prices. If your product has some unique advantages over the competition, but can also be sold within the same price range, there may be some market opportunities.
	
	Ask store managers or wholesale representatives if they’d be willing to carry your product. Provide samples to people other than your family members and friends, and ask for their opinions on all aspects of the product (flavor, visual appeal, packaging, label, etc.). Take their advice into account when making decisions about your product.

	<p>2. What does it take to operate a food business?</p>
	<textarea name="message" rows="8" cols="100">	Too often, a food business entrepreneur focuses on the product and not his/her ability to operate a small business. The start-up business owner must be able to fill several roles, or have partners or employees who can fill those roles. The answer to this question requires an honest assessment of your own capabilities and skills. It also requires an objective assessment of your weaknesses, your resources (i.e. money and time), and—if applicable—your family situation. Only you can answer this question, and you must do so before committing to the business idea.

You must be able to determine if you:

&#x2022; Are a self-starter.
&#x2022; Can make good financial and time allocation decisions.
&#x2022; Have the physical and psychological stamina to operate a fledgling business.
&#x2022; Have the ability to perform basic business record-keeping (e.g. production records, employee records, and accounting/tax preparation).
&#x2022; Can work alone when necessary.
&#x2022; Can balance the business and family life.

	Rarely does a food-business entrepreneur possess all of these qualities. Some develop qualities while trying to establish their business: reading/researching, attending workshops, taking classes and/or finding business advisors. Others find a partner with complementary strengths or hire skilled people with general business or specific food industry experience.

	<p>3. What legal structure should I use for my business?</p>
	<textarea name="message" rows="8" cols="100">	There are several options for business structure. Most small businesses in the U.S. are operated as sole proprietorships because they are simple to start and the business income is included as part of your personal income for tax purposes. However, sole proprietorships also have the disadvantage of unlimited personal liability exposure.
	
	Because of capital needs or to avoid personal liability exposure, business structures other than sole proprietorships are very common for food businesses. Options include general or limited partnerships, limited liability companies (LLCs), subchapter S corporations or subchapter C corporations. Each structure has certain advantages and disadvantages. Start-up owners are encouraged to contact legal and accounting experts to determine the best structure for their business needs.

	<p>4. How do I “protect” my product’s name or logo?</p>
	<textarea name="message" rows="8" cols="100">	The name and logo for a company’s products are intellectual property and are important to the development of brand recognition. To protect your intellectual property, make sure you trademark the name and logo. Trademarks are available on three levels: local (very limited geographic region), state and federal. State trademarks can be received from the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s office and receive only in-state protection, while federal trademarks awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) are nationally protected.
	
	Assistance with trademarks can be obtained from a number of sources, including the OSU Patent and Trademark Resource Center (affiliated with the USPTO) located in OSU’s Edmon Low Library. The Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service also provides a fact sheet titled “Intellectual Property: Protecting Your Business Assets with Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Tools” (T-4147) to help you pursue trademark protection.

	<p>5. How do I market my food product? </p>
	<textarea name="message" rows="8" cols="100">	The first step is determining the marketing channel on which you plan to focus: food service, retail or fundraiser. Each channel requires different marketing efforts. Once a channel has been selected the process for developing a “marketing mix” begins. “Marketing mix” is a general phrase used to describe the various strategies incorporated by a business to reach its intended customers. Using the four “P’s” – Product, Price, Place, Promotion – is one way a company may create the marketing effort that works best for the goals of the company. The four “P’s” can be described as follows:

&#x2022; Product: Each product has three levels. The core level includes the actual functional benefits that consumers demand from products in this food category, such as specific ingredients, nutritional characteristics, flavor and convenience factor. The next level is the actual physical image of the product. The quality of packaging, package shape/style and the visual branding of the product all play important roles. The final level of a product is it the augmented level. This level is the non-physical part of the product that adds a perception of value to the consumer. One example of the augmented product level is a product guarantee or warrantee.
&#x2022; Price: Pricing issues are related to the nature of the target market. Higher prices may be expected for a unique, high-end gourmet or specialty product, but an item that is more homogeneous with other food products in a given category will most likely be competitively priced. A wise entrepreneur will determine price based on several factors, including the price range of competitors, the cost of manufacturing the product plus an acceptable profit margin, and/or consumer willingness-to-pay for a specialty product with an identified set of product characteristics (e.g. gourmet, organic, etc.).
&#x2022; Place: Place is also commonly referred to as distribution. Distribution plans differ for products that are sold directly to the consumer versus products that are sold in retail or food-service outlets. A company focusing on Internet sales is marketing directly to the consumer. Conversely, a company focusing on retail grocery store sales will generally have a distribution chain that includes a wholesaler or distributor.
&#x2022; Promotion: Promotion relates to how a business persuades consumers to purchase its products. There are many methods for promoting a product, and each one reaches the target market in a different way. Tradeshows, couponing, direct mail and advertising are all different promotional aspects of a marketing plan.
 
	The four P’s determine a company’s ability to reach and retain members of its target market. Research and experimenting with the marketing mix are beneficial in creating successful results for a company.
